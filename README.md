# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Disruption-prediction

Right now, this repo is for reference on code that Jinxiang used for the following paper: 

Zhu, J.X., Rea, C., Montes, K., Granetz, R.S., Sweeney, R. and Tinguely, R.A., 2020. Hybrid deep-learning architecture for general disruption prediction across multiple tokamaks. Nuclear Fusion, 61(2), p.026007.

The code won't work, because we are missing ./C_Mod_sim_SPARC_HP_test.mat.
